# Phase-1-Project---Zen-Quotes
An interactive website for a user to see zen quotes and be inspired to submit their own zen quotes.


<!-- The website will open with a "Find Zen Quotes Button" -->
<!-- The button initializes 3 random objects that include the author image, author name, and quote to appear. -->
<!-- There will be a button for the user to like the Zen Cards that appear on the website. -->
<!-- The user can click on a "More Quotes" button to generate another 3 random objects to appear on the page if the first 3 weren't inspiring enough. -->
<!-- The user can post their own zen quotes with submit forms for author name, quote, and image URL -->
<!-- There will be a default image if no URL is provided -->
